The ETE-tools is a package of programs to perform common analyses and operations
on trees.

All programs in the ete_tools/ direcotry are usable in-place, but the recomended installation method is to
add the ete command in this directory to the binary path. 

In example:
 # cd /usr/local/bin
 # sudo ln -n ~/ete2/tools/ete 

Once done, you can use the ETE tools through the ete wrapper script. For example: 
 # ete dist -h
 # ete view -h

By copying or sym-linking the  ete_completion file into /etc/bash_completion.d/
directory, you will get autocompletion for the ete command line script.
