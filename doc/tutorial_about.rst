About ETE
=================

ETE is a python programming toolkit that assists in the automated
manipulation, analysis and visualization of hierarchical trees. It
provides a broad range of tree handling options, specific methods to
work on phylogenetic and clustering trees and bindings to the
phylomeDB database (containing thousands of precalculated gene
phylogenies). It also allows tree node annotation, interactive
visualization through a built-in GUI, and a highly customizable tree
drawing engine to create PDF tree images.

ETE is currently developed by the `Comparative genomics group
<http://gabaldonlab.crg.es/>`_ at the `Centre for Genomic Regulation
<http://www.crg.es/>`_

About this tutorial
=================

This document compiles a set of guided examples about general ETE
usage. It does not aim to cover exhaustively all available ETE's
methods and parameters, but to illustrate most important aspects of
each module. A comprehensive reference guide for programmers can also
be found at [http://ete.cgenomics.org/]. In addition, examples used in
this tutorial and documentation updates can be downloaded from the
same web site.
