Optional dependencies

* python-qt4 is required to visualize and render tree images.
* python-numpy is only required by ClusterTree instances but highly recommended for general usage too
* python-lxml is only required to use NexML and PhyloXML tree formats.


Installing in GNU/Linux
===============================

Dependencies
----------------

 + Ubuntu, Mint and other Debian based distributions (APT)
 
apt-get install python-numpy python-qt4 python-lxml

 + Centos, Fedora, etc (YUM)
 
yum install PyQt4.x86_64 numpy.x86_64 python-lxml.x86_64

Install
-----------

 + Install/upgrade ETE using PIP

pip install --upgrade ete2

 + Install/upgrade ETE using easy_install

easy_install -U ete2

 + Install/upgrade ETE manually.  

 Download latest version from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ete2
  
 tar -zxf ete2-x.x.x.tar.gz 
 cd ete2-x.x.x/
 python setup.py install 


Installing in OS X
======================

MacPorts
------------
This is the recommended way of installing ETE under OS X, as it will will handle all dependencies automatically.

 + Install Xcode Mac Developer tools (required by MacPorts) and XQuartz
 + Install MacPorts: http://www.macports.org/install.php
 + Install ETE from the MacPorts repository

sudo port install py27-ete2

Note 1: Make sure that you are always using the correct version of python and
pip. This is, use the Python distribution installed by MacPorts, typically at
/opt/local/bin/python2.7.

Note 2: The new ete build command depends on external tools that cannot be
automatically handled in OS X yet. The use of ete-build under OS X is currently
not tested and therefore not recommended for production environments Native

Native
---------

A basic installation of ETE can also be achieved by using the default OS X
python version. Note that some features such as tree visualization and ete-build
will not be available.
