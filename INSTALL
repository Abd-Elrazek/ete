INSTALLATION
**************

ETE requires python>=2.5 as well as several dependencies (Required
only to enable particular functions, but highly recommended):

- python-qt4 (>=4.5) [Enables tree visualization and image rendering]
- python-mysqldb (>=1.2) [Enables programmatic access to PhylomeDB]
- python-numpy (Required to work with clustering trees)
- python-lxml [Required to work whit NexML and PhyloXML phylogenetic formats]
- python-setuptools [Optional. Allows to install and upgrade ETE from PyPI repositories]

Linux
=======

In Debian based distributions (i.e. Ubuntu): 

    $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-qt4 python-mysqldb python-setuptools python-lxml
    $ easy_install -U ete2

Alternatively, you can download and manually install ETE using the
setup.py script:

    $ tar -zxf ete2-XXXX.tar.gz
    $ cd ete2-XXXX/
    $ sudo python setup.py install

MacOS
======

ETE and all its dependencies are available for intel MacOS, and can be
installed from the Macports repository.

The following recipe has been reported to work in MacOS 10.5.8.

1.) Install Mac Developer tools and X11 (required by Macports)

2.) Install Macports in your system: http://www.macports.org/install.php

3.) Install the following packages from the macports repository by
 using the "sudo port install [package_name]" syntax.  (note that some
 packages may take a long time to be built and that you will need to
 have an active internet connection during the installation process):

 Required packages:

 python26
 py26-numpy
 py26-scipy
 py26-pyqt4 
 py26-mysql

4.) Download the setup installer of the last ETE version
(http://ete.cgenomics.org/releases/ete2), uncompress it, enter its
folder and run: "sudo python setup.py install" Once the installation
has finished, you will be able to load ETE (import ete2) when running
the "right" python binary.

If step 4 doesn't work, make sure that the python version your are
using to install ETE is the one installed by MacPorts. This is usually
located in
"/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/python2.6".
By contrast, non-Macport python version is the one located in
"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/python2.6", so
check that you are using the correct python executable.
