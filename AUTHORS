ETE was originally written and currently maintained by Jaime Huerta
Cepas (jhcepas@gmail), with the valuable contribution of many other
people.

ETE was born in 2005 as a small program to visualize microarray
experiments, under the supervision of Joaquin Dopazo. Later, I started
to use similar tools to deal with phylogenetic trees. Together with
Toni Gabaldón, I implemented a lot of functionality just because we
needed in our research.

Eventually, I decided to compile all these tools in a single package
and release it for general use. Currently, you can refer to ETE using
the following citation:
